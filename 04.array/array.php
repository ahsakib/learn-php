### Array Manipulation:
- **Similar:**

array_pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns it.
array_push(): Appends one or more elements to the end of an array.
array_shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns it.
array_unshift(): Prepends one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
array_slice(): Extracts a slice of an array.
array_splice(): Removes a portion of the array and replaces it with something else.
array_merge(): Combines one or more arrays into a single array.
array_merge_recursive(): Recursively merges two or more arrays.
array_replace(): Replaces the values of the first array with the values from following arrays.
array_reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in an array.
array_chunk(): Splits an array into chunks of smaller arrays.
array_combine(): Creates an array by using one array for keys and another for its values.
array_fill(): Fills an array with a specific number of elements, all having the same value.

- **Different:**
array_diff(): Computes the difference of arrays. Returns an array containing all the values from the first array that are not present in any of the other arrays.
array_intersect(): Computes the intersection of arrays. Returns an array containing all the values that are present in all of the input arrays.
